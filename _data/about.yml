    We are a church plant committed to proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ in the coastal communities of North County San Diego.

    All Saints Presbyterian Church began in March of 2025 with a vision to bring a Reformed church rooted in historic Christian faith and practice to the growing communities of North County San Diego.

    Whether you're exploring Christianity or seeking to serve Christ by serving His church, we invite you to worship with us.
