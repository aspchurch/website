## Vision

### A Church Formed by the Gospel of Jesus Christ

#### Biblical

We believe the Bible is God's inspired Word that stands as the foundation for all we do. It is the unfolding story of God's promise of Jesus Christ to save sinners, and this is the good news of the Gospel.

#### Confessional

We uphold the authority and sufficiency of God's Word as expressed in the Westminster Confession of Faith and Catechisms, and the historic creeds of the church which include the Apostles' Creed, Nicene Creed, and Athanasian Creed.

#### Sacramental

We embrace the centrality of Word and Sacrament ministry as God's promise to His church.

## Values

### A People Formed by the Gospel of Jesus Christ

#### Formation Over Functions

We value Christ-centered community that is committed to nurturing spiritual growth through discipleship, authentic worship, and the lifelong journey of faith.

#### Authentic Worship

We value authentic worship that is grounded in the rich tradition of historic Christianity and Presbyterian liturgy that remains relevant and transformative for contemporary believers.

#### Mission Driven

We strive to be a people committed to the mission Jesus gave to the church (Matthew 28:18-20). As the Gospel renews us, we share the good news with our neighbor.
